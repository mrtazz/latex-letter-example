# Writing letters in markdown via LaTeX

This is a set of tasks and templates to be able to write letters in markdown
with any editor and have it come out as a nicely formatted PDF following the
layout of a standard German letter with the help of pandoc and LaTeX.


## Usage


```
make
```

See the example markdown file and generated PDFs for an idea what it looks
like to use this.

## Requirements

- `GNU make`
- `pandoc`
- a TeX install that provides `pdflatex`


## Caveat

This is mostly an export from my private documents repo. The provided files
may or may not work for you. But they might serve as a useful starting point.
